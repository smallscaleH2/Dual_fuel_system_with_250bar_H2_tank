Regarding the direct injection system:
the gasoline engine shown is a 4-cylinder engine; as such, 4 solenoid injector valves are needed (indicated by the numbers 1 to 4)
the speeduino completely replaces the old ECU and is itself able to:
- ignite the spark plugs and/or change the spark plug timing
- control the solenoid valves (amount of fuel injected per combustion and/or change the fuel injection timing per solenoid valve) 

regarding the control panel / air/fuel mix display & buttons (present in both the direct injection and carburator/DI system):
the control panel allows to operate solenoid valve A and solenoid valve B to completely open or close either fuel line.
Only one fuel line is allowed to be opened at a given time.
the air/fuel mix display shows the current air/fuel ratio; and "up" and "down" button is present next to it 
allowing the air/fuel mixture to be set leaner or richer.

Regarding the carburator version:
the carburator version is obviously NOT a dual-fuel system, rather it's a single-fuel system 
a special carburator system such as the lovatogas (see http://www.lovatogas.com/php/eng/cng_systems/ ) 
or the grimhall (see http://cngstore.grimhall.com/cng-conversion-kits/) might be needed
