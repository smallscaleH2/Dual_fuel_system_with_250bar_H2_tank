Regarding the direct injection system:
the gasoline engine shown is a 4-cylinder engine; as such, 4 solenoid injector valves are needed (indicated by the numbers 1 to 4)

regarding the control panel / air/fuel mix display & buttons (present in both the direct injection and carburator/DI system):
the control panel allows to operate solenoid valve A and solenoid valve B to completely open or close either fuel line.
Only one fuel line is allowed to be opened at a given time.
the air/fuel mix display shows the current air/fuel ratio; and "up" and "down" button is present next to it 
allowing the air/fuel mixture to be set leaner or richer.

Regarding the carburator system:
a special carburator system such as the lovatogas (see http://www.lovatogas.com/php/eng/cng_systems/ ) 
or the grimhall (see http://cngstore.grimhall.com/cng-conversion-kits/) might be needed
