This document describes the creation of a flexible-fuel system which contains at least one 250 bar hydrogen tank.
Besides the 250 bar hydrogen tank -which will often be a 3 gallon (type 1) CNG tank-, a liquid fuel tank is often added. This liquid fuel can be gasoline or biofuel (butanol, ethanol, ...).

USE

A flexible-fuel system which contains both a liquid fuel tank and a hydrogen fuel tank has the benefit that it can:
* use the liquid fuel (butanol, ethanol, ...) to cover long distances with it (liquid fuels have far greater energy in them than hydrogen compressed at 250 bar has)
* use the hydrogen tank for driving in cities (which is useful as this fuel generates no toxic exhaust gases, which could potentially harm citizens in these cities)
