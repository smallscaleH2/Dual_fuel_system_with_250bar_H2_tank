This document describes the creation of a dual-fuel system which contains at least one 250 bar hydrogen tank.
Besides the 250 bar hydrogen tank -which will often be a 3 gallon (type 1) CNG tank-, a liquid fuel tank is often added. 
This liquid fuel can be gasoline or biofuel (butanol, ethanol, ...).

USE
A dual-fuel system which contains both a liquid fuel tank and a hydrogen fuel tank has the benefit that it can:
* use the liquid fuel (butanol, ethanol, gasoline, ...) to cover long distances with it (liquid fuels have far greater energy in them than hydrogen compressed at 250 bar has)
* use the hydrogen tank for driving in cities (which is useful as this fuel generates no toxic exhaust gases, which could potentially harm citizens in these cities)

For the distance you can cover with the 3 gallon hydrogen tank:
The energy in this H2 tank is 8,51 kWh or hence 96 % of the energy in a 1 liter gasoline tank
This 11,35 liter (=3 gallon) tank will bring you, at a fuel consumption of 6 liter gasoline/100 km, 16 km far.
Calculation: (100/6) x 0,96 = 16

Another benefit is that the dual-fuel H2 system (compared to a regular H2 system) allows you to limit the use of hydrogen to a minimum
(to just where it's needed, i.e. cities). Liquid fuels (like ethanol and butanol) can be made using carbon-neutral (or even carbon-negative) production techniques,
whereas hydrogen can never be made in a carbon-neutral (or carbon-negative) way. So wherever liquid fuels can be used, they should be.

WORK OUT
Only (4-stroke) gasoline engines are suitable to run on hydrogen (as these have a spark plug, whereas Diesel engines do not). 
As such, the fuel in the other tank (liquid) also needs to be of a type that can be used in a gasoline engine (i.e. gasoline, butanol, ethanol).
The fuel can be switched by means of a user-operatable control panel. This control panel connects to a speeduino (which replaced the old ECU). The control panel will allow to change the air/fuel ratio (and/or spark plug timing) from inside the car.
The speeduino will change the air/fuel mix supplied to the solenoid fuel injectors (direct injection). 
With this method, the solenoid fuel injectors are hence used with either fuel used (hydrogen from hydrogen tank or gasoline/E100/E85/biobutanol/... in the liquid fuel tank). Only 1 fuel line can be open at any given time (the other line is to be closed using another solenoid valve -solenoid valve A or B-).

Another method in which we can achieve the fuel switching is by using a combination of a solenoid fuel injector and a carburetor.

On the hydrogen tank-line, there will be following components:
tank - pressure reducer - bubbler - internal combustion engine
This, out of safety reasons.

Notes:
The air/fuel ratio's are:
* 9:1 for pure ethanol (=E100)
* 9,7:1 for E85
* 14,7:1 for butanol/gasoline
* 17,2:1 for natural gas/biogas
* 34,3:1 for hydrogen

In case no hydrogen is available, natural (or bio-)gas can be used as an alternative fuel to hydrogen.
This, as although it still generates some toxic exhaust gases, it will at least burn cleaner than any of the liquid fuels and will hence still be an improvement over using liquid fuels in the cities.
As natural gas/biogas has a higher energy rating per liter (0,00925 kWh/l vs 0,003 kWh/l for hydrogen), the 3 gallon tank will bring you 3,083 times further or hence 49,33 km far (at a fuel consumption of 6 liter gasoline/100 km).
