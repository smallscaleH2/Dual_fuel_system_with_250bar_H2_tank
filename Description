This document describes the creation of a flexible-fuel system which contains at least one 250 bar hydrogen tank.
Besides the 250 bar hydrogen tank -which will often be a 3 gallon (type 1) CNG tank-, a liquid fuel tank is often added. 
This liquid fuel can be gasoline or biofuel (butanol, ethanol, ...).

USE
A flexible-fuel system which contains both a liquid fuel tank and a hydrogen fuel tank has the benefit that it can:
* use the liquid fuel (butanol, ethanol, ...) to cover long distances with it (liquid fuels have far greater energy in them than hydrogen compressed at 250 bar has)
* use the hydrogen tank for driving in cities (which is useful as this fuel generates no toxic exhaust gases, which could potentially harm citizens in these cities)

WORK OUT
Only gasoline engines are suitable to run on hydrogen (as these have a spark plug, whereas Diesel engines do not). 
As such, the fuel in the other tank (liquid) also needs to be of a type that can be used in a gasoline engine (i.e. gasoline, butanol, ethanol).
The fuel can be switched by means of a control panel that changes the air/fuel ratio (and sometimes spark plug timing) or 
by using a combination of a spark plug and a carburator (in which both use a different fuel and of which only one can operate at a given time).
