This document describes the creation of a flexible-fuel system which contains at least one 250 bar hydrogen tank.
Besides the 250 bar hydrogen tank -which will often be a 3 gallon (type 1) CNG tank-, a liquid fuel tank is often added. 
This liquid fuel can be gasoline or biofuel (butanol, ethanol, ...).

USE
A flexible-fuel system which contains both a liquid fuel tank and a hydrogen fuel tank has the benefit that it can:
* use the liquid fuel (butanol, ethanol, ...) to cover long distances with it (liquid fuels have far greater energy in them than hydrogen compressed at 250 bar has)
* use the hydrogen tank for driving in cities (which is useful as this fuel generates no toxic exhaust gases, which could potentially harm citizens in these cities)

For the distance you can cover with the 3 gallon hydrogen tank:
The energy in this H2 tank is 11,35 kWh or hence 96 % of the energy in a 1 liter gasoline tank
This 11,35 liter (=3 gallon) tank will bring you, at a fuel consumption of 6 liter gasoline/100 km, 16 km far.
Calculation: (100/6) x 0,96 = 16

Another benefit is that the flexible-fuel H2 system (compared to a regular H2 system) allows you to limit the use of hydrogen to a minimum
(to just where it's needed, i.e. cities). Liquid fuels (like ethanol and butanol) can be made using carbon-neutral (or even carbon-negative) production techniques,
whereas hydrogen can never be made in a carbon-neutral (or carbon-negative) way. So wherever liquid fuels can be used, they should be.

WORK OUT
Only gasoline engines are suitable to run on hydrogen (as these have a spark plug, whereas Diesel engines do not). 
As such, the fuel in the other tank (liquid) also needs to be of a type that can be used in a gasoline engine (i.e. gasoline, butanol, ethanol).
The fuel can be switched by means of a user-operatable control panel. This control panel connects to the ECU and will change the air/fuel ratio (and sometimes spark plug timing) 
depending on what fuel is selected on the control panel. The ECU will change the air/fuel ratio via the solenoid fuel injector (direct injection). With this method,
the solenoid fuel injector will thus connect both to a hydrogen tank and a liquid fuel tank. Only 1 fuel line will be open at any given time (the other line will be closed automatically using a valve).

Another method that in which to achieve the fuel switching is by using a combination of a solenoid fuel injector and a carburator (in which both connect to a different fuel tank and of which only one can operate at a given time).

On the hydrogen tank-line, there will be following components:
tank - pressure reducer - bubbler - internal combustion engine
This, out of safety reasons.

Notes:
The air/fuel ratio's are:
* 9:1 for ethanol
* 14,7:1 for butanol/gasoline
* 34,3:1 for hydrogen
